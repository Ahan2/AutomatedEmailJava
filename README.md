# AutomatedEmailJava
Send automated e-mails in Java without using the JavaMail API.

#Umm... why didn't you just use the JavaMail API?
Well, I needed my project to be completely client side (no servers, nothing), if I had used the JavaMail API the user would've had to install a bunch of stuff before being able to receive automated emails from my program. 

#Getting started (SendEmail.java)
